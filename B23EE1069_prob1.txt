The chatbot developed in this assignment felt partially natural in some situations, but clearly artificial in others. In the first run, the interaction seemed quite smooth and conversational. The chatbot was able to correctly extract the surname from the full name, understand the birthday written in words (“16th March 2005”), and respond appropriately when the user said they were not feeling good. In this case, the responses felt relevant and reasonably friendly, which made the conversation appear somewhat natural.

In the second run, the chatbot demonstrated one of the key strengths of regex-based systems: reliability when dealing with structured input. It correctly recognized a numeric date format (“16-03-2005”) and was also able to remember previously stored information when the user asked, “What is my name?” This showed how regular expressions work very well for pattern detection tasks such as extracting names, dates, and specific keywords. The system behaved predictably and produced accurate responses whenever the input matched the expected patterns.

However, the third run clearly revealed the limitations of a regex-based chatbot. When the user expressed more complex emotions such as feeling “agitated and anxious,” the chatbot failed to understand the context and responded with generic replies like “That’s interesting, tell me more.” It continued giving the same repetitive response even when the user asked unrelated questions or restated their feelings. This made the conversation feel mechanical and unnatural, highlighting the chatbot’s inability to truly understand meaning or context.

Overall, regex-based interaction is effective for simple, structured tasks, but it struggles to handle natural conversation. The chatbot cannot interpret nuanced emotions, maintain context, or adapt its responses dynamically, which ultimately makes it feel robotic despite its functional accuracy.
